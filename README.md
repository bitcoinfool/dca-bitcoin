# Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Bitcoin Strategy Analysis

Welcome to my third GitHub repository! This project provides scripts for analyzing the performance of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) investments in Bitcoin. The analysis includes three parts: exploring the performance across different timeframes, viewing portfolio values denominated in bitcoins, and comparing Bitcoin DCA against a cash-only portfolio. The scripts use R programming language for data fetching, processing, and visualization.

## Features

- **Part 1: Bitcoin DCA Performance Across Timeframes**
  - Fetch and clean Bitcoin historical data from Yahoo Finance and external sources.
  - Simulate DCA strategies over multiple timeframes (1-10 years).
  - Visualize portfolio growth with both static and animated plots.

- **Part 2: Bitcoin DCA Performance Denominated in BTC**
  - Calculate and visualize portfolio values directly in bitcoins.
  - Compare Bitcoin accumulation over time across different timeframes.

- **Part 3: Bitcoin DCA vs. Cash-Only Portfolio**
  - Compare Bitcoin DCA performance as a multiple of a 100% cash portfolio.
  - Visualize the relative performance across different timeframes.
